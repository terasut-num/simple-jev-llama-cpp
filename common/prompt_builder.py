"""Build the classifier instructions shared by every inference implementation.

The public entry point is prepare_prompt(request). It validates server arguments
and returns a PromptPlan containing plain strings and output-label mappings.
It does not construct messages, apply a chat template, tokenize, or run a model.
Those operations belong to the server adapter.

Conceptually, each scoring prompt has this order:

    system_prompt_prefix + prefix_instruction
    <state or conversation supplied by the adapter>
    suffix_instruction + selected_question.instruction
    <assistant generation boundary supplied by the model's chat template>
    selected_question.answer_prefix

The adapter reads next-token logits for selected_question.output_labels and
passes a label-to-logit mapping to build_answers/build_response. No sampled
completion or JSON parsing is needed: response_scoring.py assembles the
public answer from those logits.

v1 fixes formatting and label selection for all three question types.
Future changes to those rules belong in a new version, preserving the existing
formatter so different servers can agree on the same classifier text. Native
chat formatting can still differ across models.
