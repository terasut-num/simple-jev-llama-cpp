# Endpoint evaluations

Run benchmarks against a Jev-compatible classifier endpoint accepting `model`,
`questions`, and either `state` (text) or image-bearing `messages` (vision).
Python 3.10+; the runner and offline tests use only the standard library.
Models run on the endpoint, so the evaluator needs no GPU.

## Run

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 eval/run.py \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000/v1/classifier \
  --model YOUR_MODEL \
  --suite eval/suites/english/semif-authored.json \
  --output eval/results/first-run
```

Repeat `--suite` to run multiple benchmarks. For authentication, set a bearer key
in your environment and pass `--key-env JEV_API_KEY`. Use a new output directory
for each run. The included SemIf fixture needs no preparation; other datasets may.

## Prompt-format search

`prompt_search.py` orchestrates **local GGUF serving** through
`hf-server/hf_server.py` (llama.cpp), unlike the ordinary endpoint-only runner.
Install the GGUF-server dependencies (`llama-cpp-python`, built with Vulkan for
GPU use) in the interpreter used to launch it, prepare all three quick datasets,
and provide sufficient hardware:

```sh
python eval/prompt_search.py --model /models/YOUR_MODEL.gguf --list  # offline, no downloads
python eval/prompt_search.py --model /models/YOUR_MODEL.gguf --device auto --dtype bfloat16 \
  --max-model-len 32768 --output eval/results/my-prompt-search
# Hugging Face GGUF repository: pick one file and pin the commit.
python eval/prompt_search.py --model ORG/MODEL-GGUF --gguf-file MODEL-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  --revision COMMIT_SHA --device auto --output eval/results/my-gguf-search
```

The search always passes explicit policies; server auto-selection cannot influence
which candidate is tested. Defaults: `baseline examples_binary repeat_state
strict_mix_repeat2`, 477 decisions each, workers=1, no request retries, 32K context,
255-option limit. Remote branches/revisions are resolved once to an immutable
commit before loading weights; offline mode requires the cached `--gguf-file`
(or `config.json`) for that revision. Local `.gguf` files and GGUF directories
are recorded by path and size in `search.json` and must be kept unchanged during
the search. Pass `--revision COMMIT` to reproduce a specific checkpoint.

- `--policies baseline examples_binary` searches a subset; tied best formats use
  this order. The default prefers baseline on ties.
- `--device cpu --dtype float32` supports CPU testing (numerically anchored
  llama.cpp scoring); four full quick runs can be slow. The model is reloaded once
  per format. `--dtype` is the KV-cache type; GGUF weights keep their quantization.
- `--gguf-file`, `--n-gpu-layers`, `--prefix-sharing` (default `auto`), and
  `--chat-template-file` are passed unchanged to every format's server, so all
  formats run the same weights, offload, prefill strategy, and chat template. A
  format the GGUF's template cannot render fails at server startup and is
  reported as incomplete; supply `--chat-template-file` to include it.
- `--max-model-len`, `--max-choice-options`, `--max-batch-size`,
  `--max-batch-tokens`, and `--workers` stay fixed across formats. Increase context
  when needed; the tool never truncates candidates or skips difficult cases.
- `--port` (default 8179) must be unused. The server binds loopback only, uses a
  unique served ID with strict ID checking, and is terminated after each run.
  Existing servers are never adopted or stopped.
- `--startup-timeout` (1800s), `--request-timeout` (300s), and `--eval-timeout`
  (14400s per policy) bound execution. Failures, timeouts, and interruptions retain
  their logs/results. Output directories must be new; no overwrite or resume.

Each policy directory contains `server.log`, deployment/command metadata, the
normal `eval/` raw responses and native summaries, `audit.log`, and `result.json`.
`search.json` records source/data hashes, resolved checkpoint revision, GGUF
file selection, local weight sizes, chat-template hash, settings, and
package/platform information (including `llama-cpp-python`). Record accelerator details separately when
publishing results. Native response/coverage audits must pass before a run is
eligible. `comparison.json` ranks **pooled native correct/477**, using JevBench's
native accuracy and SemIf per-row accuracy—not the equal-case headline or the
full decision macro. Other native metrics remain in each suite summary.

If any requested format is incomplete, the command exits nonzero and emits **no
recommended policy**, although it shows the best complete candidates. Successful
ties are reported explicitly. Apply the winner with
`--classifier-prompt-policy POLICY`; the tool does not edit model profiles or
server defaults. These are development-selection results, not held-out estimates,
and quick does not validate 255-option accuracy. Use disjoint evaluation data for
claims about generalization.

## Portable presets and full reproduction

| Preset | Selection |
| --- | --- |
| `quick` | 231 native JevBench + 144 Authored + 102 TypeSafe = 477 decisions |
| `decision` | 20 English suites, covering the 26 matched decision items |
| `full-text` | 65 non-overlapping text suites: 86,747 input examples |
| `vision` | Seven configurations: 63,372 questions |
| `full` | `full-text` plus `vision`, without duplicate parent/child suites |

The full selections are pinned in `full-suites.json`. They retain the historical
BigCloneBench and ToolRet Web exclusions. The larger catalog also includes
opt-in suites and disjoint category partitions; **do not run every manifest**
or mix `quick` with the full JevBench tier suites, which reuse the same decisions.
The 477 cases were used for prompt development/selection, not held-out testing.

```sh
# No network, credentials, model, or dataset downloads needed to inspect a plan.
python3 eval/run.py --preset quick --list
python3 eval/run.py --preset full --list

# Build TypeSafe first using the verified upstream snapshots described below.
python3 eval/run.py --preset quick \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000/v1/classifier --model YOUR_MODEL \
  --delay 0 --output eval/results/model-quick

# After preparing ALL selected datasets, substitute decision/full-text/vision/full.
python3 eval/run.py --preset decision \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8000/v1/classifier --model YOUR_MODEL \
  --workers 4 --delay 0 --output eval/results/model-decision

# Replays saved raw responses, checks exact source/ID coverage, and rescores offline.
python3 eval/audit.py --run eval/results/model-decision --preset decision

# Reproduce the equal-item decision aggregate, retaining native report metrics.
python3 eval/compare.py --mode decision \
  --report Model=eval/results/model-decision/report.json \
  --output eval/results/decision-comparison.json
```

`--list` reports dataset-file presence, **not** validation or asset completeness.
Execution validates all selected data/images before sending requests. Missing
sources fail explicitly; there is no synthetic replacement, silent truncation,
or silent suite skipping. Preparation commands and dataset-specific optional
packages are documented in [notes/README.md](notes/README.md). TypeSafe source
records and large downloaded text/image corpora are deliberately not bundled;
obtain them under their upstream terms. The authored and native public JevBench
fixtures are included and need no preparation.

Start the model server separately, with an explicit startup prompt policy. The
runner neither picks policies from model names nor installs runtime hooks. See
[GGUF server startup configuration](../hf-server/README.md). Record the model revision,
policy, server revision, precision, and hardware in a non-secret JSON object and
optionally pass `--deployment-info FILE`; this is saved provenance, **not** a
server configuration request or verification of the remote deployment. Resume
requires identical supplied metadata, evaluator dependencies, data and settings.

Use an endpoint capable of the selected protocol: native Choice/Score/Noul,
image-bearing messages for vision, sufficient untruncated context, and (for
some full-suite ranking tasks) up to 255 candidates. The HF classifier now defaults
to `--max-choice-options 255`; this is a server capability, not an evaluator-side
truncation or workaround. Older servers may still cap Choice at 50. Check the
configured limit via `/v1/models`. HF named policies currently support text/state
requests only. A backend capacity rejection is a failure,
not permission to shrink the benchmark. Do not point bulk runs at the limited
public demo. No GPU accuracy run, backend parity claim, or performance change
is part of this tooling migration.

For controlled model comparisons, start HF with `--enforce-model-id` and send the
served ID from `/v1/models`. The permissive default accepts arbitrary request IDs;
it does not select or load that model. When using `--served-model-name`, record the
physical checkpoint and revision separately in `--deployment-info`.
The option cap does not increase the context budget: repeated-input policies can
need a larger `--max-model-len` (for example, 32768) for 255-option cases.
Overlong prompts are rejected, never truncated.

`compare.py --mode quick` pools the 477 decisions; `--mode decision` uses the
26 matched English items; `--mode text` reports the 54 matched knowledge,
decision and ranking items separately. `--mode vision` averages the seven
per-question accuracies and preserves native MME points/POPE F1 separately.
Repeat `--report NAME=PATH` for models. Comparisons reject missing items,
failures, incomplete coverage, and mismatched question counts. They check
**report metadata**, not raw evidence: run `audit.py` first for every model.
Historical Jev references under `benchmarks/` are not new endpoint measurements.
The 26-item decision **comparison** contains 21,364 input examples and 33,099
scored questions; multi-label tasks account for the difference. The `decision`
preset keeps the mixed CodeMMLU parent intact for honest project-wide coverage,
so it also executes 11,501 CodeMMLU knowledge examples, excluded from that
aggregate (32,865 input examples executed in total).

Private cloud submission, saved job handles, experiment-only backend patches,
model caches and raw run archives are not required or copied. HTTP concurrency,
resume and repair work locally against separately managed endpoints. Historical
archive paths in benchmark provenance identify old evidence, not dependencies
of the portable CLI. See [migration provenance](PORTING.md).

## Prepare and browse

```sh
python3 eval/prepare.py --help
python3 eval/prepare.py knowledge --help
python3 eval/catalog.py                    # Our category splits
python3 eval/catalog.py --view project     # Named benchmark projects
python3 eval/catalog.py --write-doc        # Generate both catalogs in notes/
```

Converters download only when explicitly requested and never call models.
See the [benchmark notes](notes/README.md) for sources and preparation commands.

## Results

Runs save predictions, scoring inputs, provenance, and per-suite summaries.
`by-category.md` and `by-project.md` provide the two reporting views. Full project
scores are recomputed from examples, not averages of category scores.

```sh
python3 eval/report.py --run eval/results/first-run --view project
```

See [reporting](notes/REPORTING.md) for coverage, partial runs, and combining runs.

For the request contract, custom adapters, and baseline details, see the
[framework reference](notes/FRAMEWORK.md).

For long runs, `--workers 16 --delay 0.02` allows up to 16 concurrent requests,
with at least 20 ms between dispatches. Choose settings appropriate to your
endpoint. `--resume` continues an interrupted output directory with identical
settings/data, preserving every saved prediction (including failures). A malformed
partial JSONL record requires review rather than automatic deletion.

The runner pauses on authentication/billing rejection or 20 consecutive errors.
Retries apply to HTTP 429 and all HTTP 5xx server errors. Context-free questions send an
empty string for `state`, compatible with System One's non-null input contract.

Export small, tracked reports per project with `report.py --export`; see
[report storage](notes/REPORTING.md#store-benchmark-reports-in-git).

BigCloneBench is opt-in because it contains 415,416 examples. Full-run selectors
should skip manifests with `default_enabled: false`; explicit `--suite` selection
still works. Other coding benchmarks remain in the default set.

To repair saved server failures after a run finishes:

```sh
python3 eval/retry.py --run eval/results/first-run --key-env JEV_API_KEY
```

Omit `--key-env` for an unauthenticated local endpoint. Keep prepared images at
their original location for repair: saved asset bindings are restored and every
image checksum is revalidated before requests.

Only HTTP 5xx failures are retried. Successful predictions are preserved, original
failures are retained in `prior_results` and a retry journal, and scores are rebuilt.
Do not retry a run while another process is writing to it.

ToolRet Web is also disabled by default: its full candidate descriptions can exceed
32K context. ToolRet Code and Customized remain enabled; no silent truncation is applied.

## JevBench public accuracy

`jevbench-public` contains the 231 released decisions at upstream revision
`83831807458d7df424a1e53e5724f3a3ffe2cf89`: 48 easy, 72 original (public
standard-tier items), and 111 hard. The published 534-decision run also includes
held-out/imported items unavailable here; no judge-tier items are public.
This suite is the public subset, not a reproduction of that full leaderboard.

```sh
python eval/run.py --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/classifier \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B --suite eval/suites/jevbench-public.json \
  --delay 0 --output eval/results/qwen35-4b-jevbench-public
```

The `jevbench-accuracy-v1` adapter preserves native choice, score and Noul
requests, including criteria order. Only state and the question's type,
instructions and criteria go to the endpoint. Labels, expected answers and
provenance stay local. It works with compatible classifier endpoints;
prompting remains endpoint-owned.

The headline is **unweighted accuracy: correct / scorable requested decisions**.
Each question counts once; no tier/family weighting, cost, speed, calibration,
or composite score is calculated. Summaries include correct counts, coverage
and accuracy by tier, family and primitive without averaging those breakdowns.
HTTP failures, context overflow and invalid distributions count wrong. All
bundled rows have gold answers; custom rows with `expected: null` are reported
as unscorable and excluded from accuracy, but still included in coverage.

Pinned upstream `scoring.py` supplies per-item semantics: choice and score use
argmax probabilities (score does **not** round the expected numeric score),
Noul maps `noul` to P(yes) and its complement to P(no). Exact ties use the
lexicographically smallest label, unlike the SemIf adapter's fixture-order tie
rule. Complete finite distributions are required, with upstream strict 0.1%
and accepted rounding 2% sum tolerances. The response's claimed choice/score
is not substituted for its distribution. There is no input truncation or RoPE
change in the evaluator.

**Published Jev 1.13.0 reference on these exact IDs: 200/231 = 86.58%.**
Easy:48/48; original:71/72; hard:81/111. Derived from upstream's public per-task
outcomes, not the weighted 90.4% full-benchmark score or a new endpoint run.
`vendor/jevbench/jev-public-reference.json` records the outcomes and source hash.

The fixtures retain every original field and add only `tier`; upstream source
hashes are in `vendor/jevbench/source-manifest.json`. Pinned upstream scoring is
unmodified, with its MIT license retained. Sources:
https://github.com/fstandhartinger/jevbench/tree/83831807458d7df424a1e53e5724f3a3ffe2cf89
and `datasets/public/{easy,original,hard}.jsonl` at that revision.
